General todo
------------
* Change debug #defines to F() all strings
* Convert static mode variables to pointers into a global static array
* Improve the snake
  - Improved color scheme
  - Fade brightness towards the tail of the snake
  - Intermittently choose a new color scheme
* Optimize triangle structure
  - Change booleans to byte + flags
  - Switch pointers to indexes
* Serial based CLI

Light pattern ideas
-------------------

1)
  Init:
    * Assign each led in every triangle a random color

  Iterate:
    * Average the three LEDs in each triangle, fade triangle to that color
    * Spread each triangle's color to the adjacent LED of its vertex neighbors
    * Repeat

(Will likely average out globally over time, add an additional cyclic or random color cycle to keep it going)

-------------------

1)
  Init:
    * Assign each led in every triangle a random color

  Iterate:
    * Average the three LEDs in each triangle, fade triangle to that color
    * Spread each triangle's color to the adjacent LED of its vertex neighbors
    * Repeat

(Will likely average out globally over time, add an additional cyclic or random color cycle to keep it going)

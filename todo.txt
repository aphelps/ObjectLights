Poofer control todo
===============
* If not fully ignited, disable when exiting control mode
* Need ability to turn it off
  - Maybe pilot valve has a disable period?
* Should disable pilot & poof if cube turns off
  - Set pilot to a long-period open rather than just on
* Send program cancel to turn off

Triangle Lights
===============

General todo
------------

* Transitions need to account for triangle not existing

* Convert static mode variables to pointers into a global static array
* Improve the snake
  - Improved color scheme
  - Fade brightness towards the tail of the snake
  - Intermittently choose a new color scheme
* Optimize triangle structure
  - Use the color data in the pixels rather than one in structure
  - Change booleans to byte + flags
  - Switch pointers to indexes
* Figure out why Life2 has only red
* Mode that lights up the points

* Global color effects to functions

Light pattern ideas
-------------------

1)
  Init:
    * Assign each led in every triangle a random color

  Iterate:
    * Average the three LEDs in each triangle, fade triangle to that color
    * Spread each triangle's color to the adjacent LED of its vertex neighbors
    * Repeat

(Will likely average out globally over time, add an additional cyclic or random color cycle to keep it going)

2) Based on trianglesVertexMerge.
  * Set a random triangle
  * Apply spread
  * Apply fade to black

3) Make spread routine that fades within triangle as well

CubeLights
==========

Todo
----

TEST
  * What happens if data comes in while handling the message returned by
  rs485Util.getMsg()?  It looks like that may read new data into the buffer
  that was returned...


* Make # of columns in SoundUnit variable
* Better volume range for SoundUnit

* Add a method of enabling a function for a limited time
* Followup functions should not be in rotation

* Add another byte to RGB to encorporate fades?

* Function to get neighboring LED along a diaganol
* Need ability to set LED to its previous color
* Mode specific event handlers
* Get MPR121 w/interrupts working
* Add Serial CLI
* Clockwise and counterclockwise functions
* Store Range finder in EEPROM
* Try using the timer based NewPing methods
* Play with Pi, get Henryâ€™s web app working, maybe control RGB light on test board
* Refactor HMTLTypes stuff to only need to include stuff that is used.

Modes
-----
* Conway's Life
  - Normal and multiple colors
  - Make intensity a separate vector
* Simple color spread/ripples
  - Splash a color that spreads to neighbors smoothly and slowly decays
* Algorithms that affect intensity
* Algorithms that affect frequency (like blink rate)

Hardware
--------
* Tab on the insert for the cap sensors should have a less tall bump

PCB
---
* Redesign so all PWM pins are available!  For some reason pin 5 goes to RS485 in v2+
  - Put 6PWM output all on one side of board

* Design light board
  - TLC5940 driving MOSFET switches

* Make one designed for just a sound sensor
  - ATMega328, 3.3V regulator, RS485

Ideas
-----
* Transmit executable code
  - Send code via RS485, read directly into PROGMEM
  - Set function pointers to appropriate place in PROGMEM
  - Magic?

* Have a during-runtime code upload ability so that a computer can send new
  modes to it directly.
  - bootloader's utilities should be accessible from the code
  - have pointers into blocks of space allocated for the modes where the
    function will be uploaded.
